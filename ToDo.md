- [ ] Convert the TempManual into docc

# Long term
- [ ] Change the plugin into a `prebuild plugin`
- [ ] Test the plugin with command line executables instead of shell scripts
- [ ] Figure out how to split the installation and the setup so it keeps working
- [ ] Remove hardcoded home folder from swift files to include
