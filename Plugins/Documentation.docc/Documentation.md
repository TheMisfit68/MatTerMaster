# ``MatTerMaster``

A couple of shell scripts that helps with the setup needed to 
develop Embedded Swift and Matter on Mac OS

## Overview

MatTerMaster is a set of 3 terminalscripts
A parent script `MatterDevelopmentSetup` that sets up the environment in the terminal to start development (and optionally calls the subscript).
A subscript `MatterDevelopmentInstaller` to install all necessary tools and SDK's.
A subscript `MatterDevelopmentUserAliases` to add user defined aliases to the terminal profile.

Additionally there is a placeholder for a Swift command plugin 
that will be used in the future to try and automate certain actions in the Matter projects that will add this pacakage as a dependency.
